# Plan-leaf-disease-classification-using-Alexnet

The AlexNet architecture is constructed using convolution neural network layers. It is made up of three fully connected layers and five convolutional
layers. The first and second convolutional layers are the overlapping max pooling layers. The third, fourth and fifth layers are in direct connection and
their output is given as input to the fully connected layers.

We used 64-bit operating system with Intel i7-9750H CPU@2.60GHz processor, RAM of 16 GB and storage of 512 GB. We implemented this project in Python language. We used python inbuilt packages such as Tensorflow, keras to implement this program. Models required for classification and image pre-processing are imported from keras. For visualization, we are using matplotloib, seaborn library.
